          Textile Hub for Refugees' Empowerment, Employment and Entrepreneurship
          Advancement in Denmark - a new model
        </p>
        <p>
          THREAD is a dynamic and innovative collaboration of diverse partners
          from business, design, education, research and refugee support
          agencies aiming to achieve life-changing results for women who are
          forging new lives in Denmark.

          Integration is a key problem for refugees and their host countries.
          This project seeks to help solve this problem by developing and
          testing a pioneering themed model of Empowerment, Employment and
          Entrepreneurship opportunities. The model offers a step-change
          programme to women refugees with differing levels of life experience
          and educational qualifications, which may be accessed according to
          their individual confidence and competence.
        </p>
        <p>The project is funded by Innovationsfonden.</p>
